* partition the code into the basic blocks by by demarkators 
* fill out the symbol table and the registor descriptor and the address discriptor
* whether to make a class for each variable and register ?
* How to fill the symbol table
* Account for the commutativity of the operators
* Taking care of the copy statements
* At the end of the basic block dump the values of all the registers 
* Register allocation
** call the function getreg to obtain the registers R_x, R_y, R_z and load x and y if not in there, update the tables
